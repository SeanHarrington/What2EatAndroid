What2Eat is a free to use application across the Linux, Windows, and Android platforms.

Feature 1(free):
It allows the user to store food eating habit information about any number of people.
All data is stored locally on their device and no outside source has access to this information.

Feature 2(provisional cost): 
The user may download eating habit information about anyone they have an email address for.
To do this, attach an email address to the users in their local DB and then hit the update button.
All users in the local DB with a valid email address will be uploaded to a remote server, inserted/averaged in with existing information.
The server will then return the averaged information it has stored to the user's local DB providing them an aggragated view of the food eating habit.
In short, share what you know, and we will share it back.
